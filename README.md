# TextExtract - Screen Text Extraction Tool

TextExtract is a screen text extraction tool using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to capture text from anywhere on your screen. Perfect for copying text from applications, images, videos, or any other screen content that doesn't allow normal text selection.

## Features

- **Quick Text Extraction**: Select any area on your screen and extract text using OCR technology
- **Multi-Monitor Support**: Works with multi-monitor setups, allowing you to choose which monitor to capture from
- **Visual Control Panel**: Easy-to-use floating control panel for quick access to features
- **System Tray Integration**: Stays out of your way in the system tray until you need it
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Quick access using convenient keyboard shortcuts
- **Desktop Integration**: Proper Windows desktop integration with Start Menu entries and desktop shortcuts
- **Google Vision API**: Powered by Google's advanced OCR technology for accurate text extraction

## SaaS Deployment

This application uses a SaaS (Software as a Service) model with embedded Google Vision API credentials. As a developer deploying this application:

1. Create a Google Cloud account if you don't have one at [https://cloud.google.com/](https://cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new Google Cloud project
3. Enable the Vision API for your project: Go to APIs & Services > Library > Search for "Vision API" > Enable
4. Create a service account: Go to APIs & Services > Credentials > Create Credentials > Service Account
5. Create a JSON key for your service account: Click on your service account > Keys > Add Key > Create New Key > JSON
6. Download the JSON key file
7. You can embed the credentials in three ways:
   - Set the `GOOGLE_VISION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable with the contents of the JSON file before building
   - Encode the JSON as base64 and set `GOOGLE_VISION_CREDENTIALS=base64:<encoded-json>` to hide the raw credentials
   - Edit `src/config.py` and add your base64-encoded credentials directly to the `HARDCODED_CREDENTIALS` variable (most secure for distribution)

The third option is recommended for distribution as it permanently embeds the credentials in the compiled application, ensuring users don't need to set up their own credentials or environment variables.

Users of your application won't need to set up their own Google Vision API credentials as they'll use your embedded credentials.

   ```

4. Prepare your Google Vision credentials using the provided utility script:
   ```
   python prepare_credentials.py path/to/your/credentials.json --base64 --export
   ```
   Use the output to set the GOOGLE_VISION_CREDENTIALS environment variable or store it securely for later use.

5. Build the installer:
   ```
   build_installer.bat
